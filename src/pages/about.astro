		My name is Sang-Yong Oh, and I am originally from South Korea. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, where I specialized in international economics and industrial organization. My doctoral training allowed me to engage deeply with both theoretical and empirical literature in international trade, as well as in industrial organization, particularly focusing on the dynamic economic relationships between the United States and East Asian countries. Over the course of my research, I have developed a strong foundation in applied microeconomics and have gained extensive experience working with large and complex datasets, applying econometric methods to address real-world economic questions.

In addition to my research, I have built a broad teaching portfolio. Since 2006, I have taught and assisted in the development of numerous economics courses at institutions including the University at Buffalo, Buffalo State College, and Bloomsburg University. My teaching experience covers a wide spectrum of courses such as Principles of Microeconomics, Principles of Macroeconomics, Intermediate Microeconomics, Intermediate Macroeconomics, Econometrics, Business and Economics Mathematics, and Business and Economics Statistics. Beyond these, I am also well-prepared and enthusiastic about teaching advanced topics in International Trade, Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconomics, and Econometrics, areas that align closely with both my research interests and academic expertise. My years of teaching have allowed me to refine a clear, student-focused approach to economics education, fostering both technical understanding and applied problem-solving skills.

More recently, I have expanded my skill set by actively studying Data Analytics and Machine Learning. My goal is to apply these advanced analytical methods to deepen and modernize the empirical study of international trade, with a particular emphasis on the gravity model of trade. By integrating machine learning techniques with traditional econometric approaches, I aim to uncover new patterns in trade flows, assess the evolving roles of countries within global value chains, and provide more accurate forecasts of trade relationships. This ongoing training allows me to bridge the gap between economics and data science, enhancing the robustness of my research while also preparing me to bring cutting-edge quantitative methods into the classroom.

    Taken together, my background reflects a commitment to both scholarship and teaching. I bring a strong combination of expertise in international trade and industrial organization, proficiency in applied econometrics, and a growing mastery of data science tools that are increasingly essential for economic research. I am eager to continue contributing to the field through innovative research, while also helping students develop the analytical and critical thinking skills needed to understand and shape the global economy.
